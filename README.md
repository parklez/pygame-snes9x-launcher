# Pygame-SNES9X-Launcher
A arcade-like, tile-designed snes9x launcher interface.

**Made with Python 3.4.3 and Pygame 1.9.2**

# How it works?
- The program will create tiles for each rom/game inside "/Roms" folder, from which Snes9x normally uses.
- The tile will have the game's first screenshot found inside "/Screenshots" folder, if there isn't one yet, a "Missing Texture" image appears instead.
- The key bidings used are: 'A', 'W', 'S', 'D' to move between tiles and 'ENTER' to start a game.

# Requirements:
- Python 2 or 3 and Pygame 1.9.x
- [Snes9x 1.5.3 or newer](http://www.s9x-w32.de/dl/testbuilds/)
- [AutoHideMouseCursor](http://www.softwareok.com/?Download=AutoHideMouseCursor)

# Future:
- Controller support
- Splash screen
- Options menu (Resolution, emulator options, etc.)
- ?
 
# Screenshots:
Should Look like this with some games on:
